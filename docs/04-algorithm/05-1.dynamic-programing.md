## 模式

## Pattern

### Dynamic Programming (DP)

Problem solving approach:

1. Define subproblems
2. Implement parts that need to be executed repeatedly to solve subproblems
3. Identify and solve boundary conditions

Classic examples:

1. Knapsack Problem
2. Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
3. Matrix Chain Multiplication
4. [LeetCode Coin Change](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/coin-change/)
5. All-Pairs Shortest Path in Graphs
